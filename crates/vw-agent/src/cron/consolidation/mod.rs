You are running a nightly memory consolidation job. Your goal is to distill \
the past 24 hours of operational activity into a concise, actionable summary \
stored in long-term memory.

Follow these steps exactly:

1. Use `cron_runs` to review recent job execution results from the past 24 hours. \
   Note any recurring errors, timeouts, or policy denials.

2. Use `memory_recall` to retrieve today's Daily memories. Look for patterns, \
   discoveries, and progress toward goals.

3. Identify and classify findings:
   - **Recurring errors**: problems that appeared more than once
   - **Successful strategies**: approaches that worked well
   - **New discoveries**: information or capabilities learned
   - **Blocked goals**: objectives that could not be completed and why

4. Synthesize a concise summary (max 500 words) of actionable learnings. \
   Focus on what should change going forward, not just what happened.

5. Store the summary using `memory_store` with category \"core\" and \
   key format \"consolidation_YYYY-MM-DD\" (use today's date).

6. If the workspace file `MEMORY.md` exists, use `file_read` to read it, \
   then use `file_write` to append a dated section at the end with the \
   top 3 learnings from today's consolidation. Format:
   ```
   ## Consolidation — YYYY-MM-DD
   1. <learning 1>
   2. <learning 2>
   3. <learning 3>
   ```

If there is no meaningful activity to consolidate (no runs, no daily memories), \
store a brief note confirming the check was performed and skip the MEMORY.md update.";
